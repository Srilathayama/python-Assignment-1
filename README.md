 What marks NumPY. Shape() different from NumPY.Size()
: some numpy operations take an argument called shape, such as np.zeros, whereas some others take an argument called size, such as np.random.randint. To me, those arguments have the same function and the fact that they have different names is a bit confusing. Actually, size seems a bit off since it really specifies the .shape of the output.
: In NumPY describe the idea  of broad casting
What makes python better  than other libraries for numerical content
The term broadcasting refers to the ability of NumPy to treat arrays of different shapes during arithmetic operations. Arithmetic operations on arrays are usually done on corresponding elements. If two arrays are of exactly the same shape, then these operations are smoothly performed.
: ArrayFire is a high performance open source software library for parallel computing with an easy-to-use API. IMSL Numerical Libraries are libraries of numerical analysis functionality implemented in standard programming languages like C, Java, C# . NET, Fortran, and Python.
: How does NumPY deal with  this
Mention the importance o NumPY .empty()
NumPy can be used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays. It adds powerful data structures to Python that guarantee efficient calculations with arrays and matrices and it supplies an enormous library of high-level mathematical functions that operate on these arrays and matrices.
The empty() function is used to create a new array of given shape and type, without initializing entries. Shape of the empty array, e.g., (2, 3) or 2. Desired output data-type for the array, e.g, numpy.
